# Image to Pencil Sketch Conversion Project

## Introduction

This project aims to convert a regular image into a pencil sketch using the popular computer vision library, OpenCV (cv2). The process involves various image processing techniques to simulate the appearance of a pencil-drawn sketch. The project is implemented in Python, making it easily accessible to a wide range of users.

## Installation

To run the project locally, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your machine. If you don't have them already, you can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/himanshumahajan138/Image-To-Pencil-Sketch.git
```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd Image-To-Pencil-Sketch
```

3. Run the conversion script:

```bash
python Himanshu_Sketch.py
```

Now After Running This Script Provide Image Path in input Section Then File Will Be saved to same Location.

## Example

Let's say we have an image named `Himanshu.jpg` that we want to convert into a pencil sketch. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
python Himanshu_Sketch.py
>> "Himanshu.jpg"
```

After the conversion is complete, you will find the pencil sketch image saved as `Sketched_Image_By_Himanshu.jpg` in the same directory.
